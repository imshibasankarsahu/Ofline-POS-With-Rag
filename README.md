# Offline RAG Voice-to-Text Point-of-Sale (POS) Prototype

## Project Overview

This project is an **offline Point-Of-Sale (POS) system** that uses local speech-to-text (STT), semantic product search (RAG), and a local language model for simple interactive shopping commands. It is designed to run entirely offline and demonstrate AI-powered POS automation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- All requirements in `requirements.txt`
- [Vosk English STT model](https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models)
- An audio file: mono, wav, 16kHz preferred

---

## Installation & Setup

1. **Clone or download this repository.**

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download and extract the Vosk Model**
   - Visit: [https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models](https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models)
   - Download `vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15` (or similar)
   - Extract it to the `models/` folder as shown above

4. **Prepare your audio file**
   - Make sure the `.wav` audio file you want to test (e.g., `sample_audio.wav`) is in the project root

5. **Edit and expand `inventory.csv`**
   
6.*streamlit run app for workig project
 
   ```
   strewamlit run mainapp.py
   ```

---

## Usage

- By default, runs `main("sample_audio.wav")`, which processes the audio command and prints
  - The speech transcript
  - Action taken (add/remove/checkout)
  - The final shopping cart and total
- To use with a different audio file, change the filename in `main()`

---

## How it Works

1. **Speech-to-Text**
   - Converts your spoken command from `.wav` audio to text using Vosk (offline)

2. **Semantic Product Search (RAG)**
   - Finds the best-matching product in `inventory.csv`, powered by sentence-transformers and FAISS

3. **Command Handling & Cart**
   - Decides what to do: add/remove/checkout — and updates the cart

---

## Example Inventory (`inventory.csv`)

```
name,price
milk,50
bread,30
```

---

## Tips & Customization

- Supports "add", "remove", and "checkout" commands.
- Supports natural language search (e.g., "add a packet of eggs", "remove one banana").
- Expand `inventory.csv` and tune models as needed.
- For production, improve quantity extraction and error handling.
